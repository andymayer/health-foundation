# Migrant Health prototype site

This is the static prototype site we have been developing and testing, which runs on Jekyll. There are static HTML files (with example content in), partials for regularly used layout stuff (stored in the 'includes' directory), and sass stylesheets (in the 'sass' directory).

## Installation
